# STREET DEBUGGER
A dynamic web application solution to issues/complaints members of the community may have regarding their town e.g. pot holes and noisy neighbours who don't know who to contact about the issue. I created the contact and searchProblems pages. 
## Dependencies
* Apache 
* H2 
### What I used
* Formspree.io for a simple, sans-PHP contact form
* Eclipse 
* Bootstrap for responsive design
* Fontawesome.com for icons
